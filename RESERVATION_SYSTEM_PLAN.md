# Reservation System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the Cal3 reservation/booking system, which allows businesses to manage seat/resource reservations.

## Database Entities (✅ COMPLETED)

The following entities have been fully implemented and are functional:

1. **Organisation** (`organisation.entity.ts`)
   - Core entity for business/company management
   - ManyToMany relationship with Users
   - OneToMany relationship with ResourceTypes

2. **ResourceType** (`resource-type.entity.ts`)
   - Define categories of bookable resources
   - Configurable settings: minBookingDuration, bufferTime, customerInfoFields
   - Flags: waitlistEnabled, recurringEnabled

3. **Resource** (`resource.entity.ts`)
   - Individual bookable items (tables, chairs, slots)
   - Has capacity property
   - Managed by specific User

4. **OperatingHours** (`operating-hours.entity.ts`)
   - Define operating hours per resource type
   - Day of week, open/close times

5. **Reservation** (`reservation.entity.ts`)

   - Statuses: pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled, waitlist
   - Support for recurring reservations via parentReservationId and recurrencePattern

6. **User** (`user.entity.ts` - Updated)
