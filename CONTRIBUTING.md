# Contributing to Cal3

Last updated: 2026-02-03

Contributions should improve maintainability, correctness, and clarity. Keep changes focused, validate thoroughly, and update documentation when behavior or contracts change.

## Development Expectations
Use small branches, descriptive commits, and reviewable pull requests. Avoid combining unrelated refactors in one change, especially in areas with active feature work.

## Validation
Run type checks, linting, and relevant test/build commands before requesting review. For runtime-affecting changes, include startup and basic flow validation evidence.

## Documentation Requirement
New or changed behavior must be reflected in the docs tree with narrative explanations, not only lists. Documentation should explain intent, expected behavior, and operational implications.
