First run should validate the complete user flow, not only process startup. The minimum path is login, calendar creation, and event creation.

## Operational Notes
Also verify reservation views, feature flags, and permission-based UI sections load correctly, because these often reveal hidden backend configuration issues.

## Guidance
Capture first-run results in team onboarding notes to make future setup troubleshooting faster.
