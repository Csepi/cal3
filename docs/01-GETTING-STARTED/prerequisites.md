Cal3 relies on modern Node.js and TypeScript tooling, so consistent version baselines are important for predictable behavior.

## Operational Notes
Use Node.js 18+ and npm 9+, plus a supported database engine. Docker is optional but highly recommended when teams need reproducible local environments.

## Guidance
If setup differs across contributors, document it immediately and reconcile to a single team baseline to reduce onboarding friction.
