## The Problem This Solves
New tools often drown you in setup details before you see any value. You need one short path to proof that Cal3 works.

## Real Scenario
In one short session, you launch both services, log in, create an event, and confirm your first scheduling workflow is alive.

## How It Works
Quickstart is intentionally focused: start core services, validate connectivity, and complete one meaningful action.

## Get Started in 5 Minutes
1. Install dependencies.
2. Configure backend environment values.
3. Start backend on 8081 and frontend on 8080.
4. Log in and create one event.
5. Verify no auth loop and successful API calls.

Screenshot walkthrough: You should see a populated dashboard timeline and a successful network request in browser dev tools.

## Pro Tips
- Keep backend logs visible while testing.
- Verify API base URL first if auth fails.
- Save a known-good startup checklist for teammates.

## What's Possible
Once quickstart is done, you can add booking links, automations, sync integrations, and team workflows quickly.

## Troubleshooting
Connection refused usually means backend is not running or DB is unreachable. Login loops usually mean token refresh endpoint cannot be reached.
