Quickstart is for getting a working local environment quickly. It gives the shortest practical route from clone to a usable login and event workflow.

## Operational Notes
Install dependencies in root, backend, and frontend. Configure backend environment variables, start backend on 8081, start frontend on 8080, then confirm login and event creation.

## Guidance
Once this path works, continue with installation and environment docs for durable setup and team consistency.
