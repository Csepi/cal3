[Back](./README.md)

Automation evaluates triggers, conditions, and actions so repetitive scheduling tasks can run without manual intervention.

## Operational Notes
Rules should be explicit, auditable, and safe under retries, especially when actions call external services.

## Guidance
Keep automation rules focused and test new rules in controlled environments before broad rollout.
