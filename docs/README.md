# Documentation Hub

Last updated: 2026-02-03

This is the main entry point for Cal3 documentation. It is structured by audience and task so that new users, developers, and operators can each find the right guide without searching through legacy content.

Every numbered section contains narrative documentation with practical context, expected behavior, and extension guidance. Historical material remains archived for traceability, but active work should follow this new structure.
