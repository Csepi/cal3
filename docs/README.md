# Cal3 Documentation: From First Setup to Full Automation

Last updated: 2026-02-03

This documentation is written to help you move from confusion to confidence quickly. Every guide explains why the topic matters, gives a real scenario, shows a practical path, and points to the next move.

## Choose Your Path
- Need momentum now? Start with `QUICKSTART.md`.
- Setting up a real environment? Go to `01-GETTING-STARTED/`.
- Building features? Jump to `03-FEATURES/` and `06-DEVELOPER-GUIDES/`.
- Integrating with external tools? Use `04-API-REFERENCE/`.
- Shipping to production? Follow `07-DEPLOYMENT/` and `09-TROUBLESHOOTING/`.

## Why This Structure Works
Instead of dry lists, each section tells you what transformation you get, where teams usually get stuck, and how to get a fast win.
