## The Problem This Solves
Users need practical guidance, not abstract feature descriptions.

## Real Scenario
A user follows one guide and completes a full workflow successfully on first try.

## How It Works
This guide is action-first and uses concrete outcomes as checkpoints.

## Get Started in 5 Minutes
1. Start with one small, high-value use case.
2. Validate expected result in UI or logs.
3. Add one advanced option.
4. Capture the pattern for team reuse.

Screenshot walkthrough: Look for a clean flow from trigger/action to visible result, with status indicators confirming completion.

## Pro Tips
- Keep changes small and observable.
- Prefer clear naming and explicit settings.
- Save successful patterns as templates.

## What's Possible
Once this workflow is stable, it compounds into faster operations and fewer manual handoffs.

## Troubleshooting
If behavior is unexpected, check configuration, permissions, and request logs before changing code or rules.
