[Back](./README.md)

Integrations include calendar sync providers, notifications, smart-home connectors, and MCP-capable agent tooling.

## Operational Notes
Because these are reliability boundaries, each integration should include retries, error context, and observability hooks.

## Guidance
External system behavior changes over time, so integration docs should be reviewed regularly alongside production incidents.
