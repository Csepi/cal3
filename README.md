# Cal3: Your Calendar Just Got Superpowers

Stop switching between apps, stop juggling bookings, and stop spending your best hours on scheduling admin.

Cal3 is where calendars, reservations, automation, and integrations finally work as one system. You can run team schedules, publish booking links, trigger follow-ups automatically, and connect workflows to the rest of your stack without duct-tape scripts.

## The Problem Cal3 Solves
Most teams live in scheduling chaos: one calendar for work, another for personal tasks, separate booking forms, and manual reminders that always slip.

That chaos costs real time, real revenue, and real trust.

## What Changes After Cal3
With Cal3, one booking can trigger your entire workflow:
- availability is updated in one place
- confirmations are sent automatically
- team visibility updates instantly
- optional API/webhook actions push downstream systems

You stop managing scheduling manually and start running a repeatable operation.

## Real Scenario
Before Cal3, a consultant spends two hours every week handling booking emails, reminders, and follow-ups. After switching, clients self-book, reminders send automatically, and calendar conflicts drop sharply. Those recovered hours become billable work.
