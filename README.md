# Cal3

Cal3 is a scheduling platform that combines calendar management, reservations, automation, and integration workflows. It is designed for teams that need reliable day-to-day planning and clear operational control.

The platform uses a React frontend and NestJS backend with typed API contracts. This design supports maintainable feature growth, safer refactors, and better incident diagnosis through standardized response and error patterns.
