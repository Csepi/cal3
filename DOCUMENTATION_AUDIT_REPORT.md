## Gap Analysis
The unified docs tree now includes smart-home, automation, agents/MCP, public booking, multi-tenancy, sync integrations, error catalog, migrations, and deployment scaling guidance.

## Consolidation Actions Applied
- Moved legacy top-level docs into `docs/archives/legacy/` where newer equivalents exist in numbered sections.
- Moved historical reports into `docs/archives/reports/`.

## Suggested Deletions (After Team Review)
- Draft/deprecated markdown files if discovered in future scans.
- Duplicate setup/API docs outside `docs/` after external link checks.

## Cleanup Commands
```bash
git rm <obsolete-doc.md>
git mv <legacy-doc.md> docs/archives/legacy/<legacy-doc.md>
```
